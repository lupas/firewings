# Included Functions

## Firestore

### queryFirestore()
```js
queryFirestore()
```

This function gets you an item, an array of items or an object of items from a Firebase query without you having to care about loops or getting the data from the snapshot. You'll just get the objects right away.

In addition you get the documents `id` and `path` for every object, too.

See the details [here](/functions/firestore/).

### unwrapFirestoreDoc()
```js
unwrapFirestoreDoc()
```

This function unwraps a Firestore snapshot of a single- or multiple-document query and returns the item(s)' data as objects. Either as an array of objects, object of objects or as a single object.

Additionally, it adds the documents `id` and `path` to every item.

See the details [here](/functions/firestore/).

### addToFirestore()
```js
addToFirestore()
```

This function takes a reference and an object as payload and adds it to Firestore. It returns the added object including its Firebase `id` and `path`.

See the details [here](/functions/firestore/).

### setToFirestore()
```js
setToFirestore()
```

This function takes a query and an object as payload and sets (updates or creates) the document in Firestore. Befrore that, the properties `id` and `path` will be removed from the object, so it won't be written to Firestore.

See the details [here](/functions/firestore/).

### changeDocId()
```js
changeDocId()
```

This function changes the id of an existing document to a new id. It does this by creating a new document with the new key, and then deleting the old document

See the details [here](/functions/firestore/).
