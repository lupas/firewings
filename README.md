> Give Firebase wings! - Useful helper-functions for Firebase's JS SDK.

## Requirements

Make sure you have Firebase installed in your project and Firestore initiated.

```json
"dependencies": {
  "firebase": "^5.7.2"
}
```

## Install

```bash
npm i firewings
```

## Setup

Add the below code to wherever you want to use the functions.

```js
import { queryFirestore } from 'firewings'
//or
import { unwrapFirestoreDoc } from 'firewings'
//or
import { addToFirestore } from 'firewings'
//or
import { setToFirestore } from 'firewings'
//or
import { changeDocId } from 'firewings'
```

# Included Functions

## queryFirestore()

This function gets you an item, an array of items or an object of items from a Firebase query without you having to care about loops or getting the data from the snapshot. You'll just get the objects right away.

In addition you get the documents `id` and `path` for every object, too.

**TRADITIONAL WAY**:

```js
/** 1.1 Define single-doc ref/query  */
const query = db.collection('cities').doc('cityId')

/** 1.2  Define multi-doc ref/query */
const query = db.collection('cities')

/** 2. Get Snapshot */
const snapshot = await query.get()

/** 3.1 Get data from Snapshot if single-doc query */
const city = snapshot.data()

/** 3.2 Get data from Snapshot if multiple-doc query */
let cities = []
for (const doc of snapshot.docs) {
  let city = doc.data()
  cities.push(city)
}
```

**WITH FIREWINGS**:

```js
// For single-doc queries:
const query = db.collection('cities').doc('cityId')
const city = await queryFirestore(query)
```

```js
// For multi-doc queries:
const query = db.collection('cities')
const cities = await queryFirestore(query)
```

Furthermore you can use the second argument to return the data of a multi-doc querie as an `object` instad of an `array`.

This will retun a array:

```js
// For multi-doc queries which retuns an array:
const query = db.collection('cities')
const cities = await queryFirestore(query)
// or
const cities = await queryFirestore(query, false)
```

```js
// const cities looks like
;[
  {
    id: 'A',
    path: 'cities/A'
  },
  {
    id: 'B',
    path: 'cities/B'
  },
  {
    id: 'C',
    path: 'cities/C'
  }
]
```

This will return an object:

```js
// For multi-doc queries which return an object:
const query = db.collection('cities')
const cities = await queryFirestore(query, true)
```

```js
// const cities looks like
{
  A: {
    id: "A",
    path: "cities/A"
  },
  B: {
    id: "B",
    path: "cities/B"
  },
  C: {
    id: "C",
    path: "cities/C"
  },
}
```

## unwrapFirestoreDoc()

This function unwraps a Firestore snapshot of a single- or multiple-document query and returns the item(s)' data as objects. Either as an array of objects, object of objects or as a single object.

Additionally, it adds the documents `id` and `path` to every item.

**TRADITIONAL WAY**:

```js
/** For single-doc queries */
const city = snapshot.data()
city.id = snapshot.id
city.path = snapshot.ref.path
```

```js
/** For multi-doc queries */
let cities = []
for (const doc of snapshot.docs) {
  let city = doc.data()
  item.id = doc.id
  item.path = doc.ref.path
  items.push(item)
}
```

**WITH FIREWINGS**:

```js
/** For single-doc queries returns an single object*/
const city = unwrapFirestoreDoc(snapshot)
```

```js
/** For multi-doc queries returns an array of objects*/
const cities = unwrapFirestoreDoc(snapshot)
```

```js
/** For multi-doc queries returns an object of objects*/
const cities = unwrapFirestoreDoc(snapshot, true)
```

For more information about returning objects read the chaperter **queryFirestore**.

## addToFirestore()

This function takes a reference and an object as payload and adds it to Firestore. It returns the added object including its Firebase `id` and `path`.

**TRADITIONAL WAY**:

```js
const ref = await ref.add(data)
data.id = ref.id
data.path = ref.path
return data
```

**WITH FIREWINGS**:

```js
return await addToFirestore(ref, data)
```

## setToFirestore()

This function takes a query and an object as payload and sets (updates or creates) the document in Firestore. Befrore that, the properties `id` and `path` will be removed from the object, so it won't be written to Firestore.

**TRADITIONAL WAY**:

```js
let clone = Object.assign({}, data)
let id = clone.id
delete clone.id
delete clone.path
await ref.doc(id).set(clone)
```

**WITH FIREWINGS**:

```js
await setToFirestore(ref.doc(id), data)
```

It's also possible to do batched writes.

```js
// Get a new write batch
let batch = db.batch()

// Set something
await setToFirestore(ref.doc(id), data, batch)

// Delete something
await batch.delete(ref.doc(id))

//  Set again something
await setToFirestore(ref2.doc(id), data, batch)

// Commit the batch
batch.commit().then(function() {
  // ...
})
```

## changeDocId()

This function changes the id of an existing document to a new id. It does this by creating a new document wwith the new key, and then deleting the old document.

> WARNING: Only do this, if you are sure what you are doing. The old document will be deleted, so any references might be invalid. Also make sure you have no onDelete() actions that you don't want to get triggered.

**TRADITIONAL WAY**:

```js
// First get the document
const doc = await queryFirestore(docRef)
// Then save it under the new id
const newRef = docRef.parent.doc(newKey)
const newDoc = await setToFirestore(newRef, doc)
// Then delete the old document and return the new document
await docRef.delete()
```

**WITH FIREWINGS**:

```js
await changeDocId(ref, 'newId')
```

### Disclaimer

These are just some quick functions I personally used in different Firebase projects to save some repeating lines of code. Since I used that in every project, I decided to build a node module out of it to easily manage it.
