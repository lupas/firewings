## What is this?

Useful helpers functions to save you some boilerplate code in your projects.

::: danger
These functions help you interact with Firebase in an even more simple way, but that also means that some of these functions do **loops** and **multiple calls** to your Firebase data, which might result in costs depending on the size of your project.

DON'T USE THIS MODULE IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE INDIVIDUAL FUNCTIONS DO.

Each function is quite simple and it's code can be seen on the GitHub repo. Make use of it.

## Disclaimer

As mentioned above, only use these helper functions if you understand what they do. Don't update to a major version without checking what changed. We don't take responsibility for your Firebase bills. ;)
